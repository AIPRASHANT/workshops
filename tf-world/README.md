# Booth Demos for TensorFlow World

### [Interactive Notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/workshops/blob/master/tfx_labs/Lab_1_Pipeline_in_Colab.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how to use Jupyter/Colab notebooks for TFX iterative development. Here, we walk through the Chicago Taxi example in an interactive notebook.

Working in an interactive notebook is a useful way to become familiar with the structure of a TFX pipeline. It's also useful when doing development of your own pipelines as a lightweight development environment, but you should be aware that there are differences in the way interactive notebooks are orchestrated, and how they access metadata artifacts.
